# React Firebase authentication demo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

1. Signin to your Firebase account or create one if you do not yet have one here: [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
1. Create a new Firebase project in the Firebase console.
1. Register a new web app within the Firebase project.
1. Copy your Firebase web apps SDK props into a `.env` at the root of this project.

### Example .env

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=
REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN="
REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL=
REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=
REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET=
REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
REACT_APP_APP_ID=
REACT_APP_MEASUREMENT_ID=
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
